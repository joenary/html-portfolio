<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Joenary, and I like to share a little bit about my self. Im 32 this year(2024), 
  and I graduated with a Computer Science Degree way back in 2012, and became a Unity 3d Developer,
  using C# as my main programming lanuage from 2012 to 2018. I used to work on a company based in Denmark, 
  from 2012 to 2015, and did freelancing jobs from 2015 to 2018. During those time, I lived on the city
  far away from my hometown, an I was totally burnt out. So by 2018, I decided to go back home
  and rest for a while, but due to some circumstances, I totally stopped programming, until this year.
</p>

<p>So this year 2024, I plan to come back, and i decided to to focus on Web Developement. So I enroled in this
  Web Development Bootcamp with teacher Miss Angela Yu and hopefully learn web development from the ground up.
  Although I am starting from the very basic of HTML, its actually very enjoyable.
